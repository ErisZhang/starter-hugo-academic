Hi! I am a second-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at [Stanford University](https://engineering.stanford.edu/), advised by Prof. [ Doug L. James](https://graphics.stanford.edu/~djames/). My research has been generously supported by a [Stanford Graduate Fellowship](https://vpge.stanford.edu/fellowships-funding/sgf/details).

I have a board interest in computer graphics, including physical simulation, geometry processing and computational fabrication. My current research is primarily focusing on developing computational models and tools via numerical methods for enhancing user creativity and productivity in design, animation and simulation.

Before, I did my undergrad at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/), advised by Prof. [Alec Jacobson](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~jacobson/). I was also fortunate to do research with Profs. [Marc Alexa](https://www.cg.tu-berlin.de/team/prof-dr-marc-alexa/), [David Levin](http://142.93.146.228/researchdb/), [Fanny Chevalier](http://fannychevalier.net/) and [Ken Jackson](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~krj/) there, getting exposed to various topics in computer graphics, human computer interaction and numerical analysis. I also did wonderful internships at [Adobe Research](https://research.adobe.com/), where I started to work with my mentor Dr. [Danny Kaufman](http://dannykaufman.io/).
